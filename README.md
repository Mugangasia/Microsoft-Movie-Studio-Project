# Microsoft Movie Studio


## Problem Statement
Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio, but they have no experience in the movie industry. As a data analyst, we have been tasked with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. Our objective is to translate our findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to decide what type of films to create.

## Data
We will be using movie and movie rating databases to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). The databases will contain information on movies, including genres, ratings, revenue, budgets, directors, actors, and production countries.

## Methodology
We will conduct EDA on the movie and movie rating databases to identify trends and patterns in box office success. We will analyze factors such as genre, time period, ratings, budget, director, actor, and production country to identify what makes a successful movie. We will also identify any seasonal trends in movie releases and revenue.

## Questions to be Answered
We will aim to answer the following questions:

* What are the most successful genres at the box office?
* How do ratings and revenue vary across different genres and time periods?
* Are there any seasonal trends in movie releases and revenue?
* Who are the most successful directors and actors in terms of revenue and ratings?
* What is the average budget for successful movies, and how does it vary across different genres?
* Are there any relationships between critical acclaim (e.g. movie ratings from critics) and box office revenue?
* What are the most popular countries for movie production and distribution, and how do their box office revenues compare?
* Are there any patterns in the runtime of successful movies, and how do they vary across different genres?
Results
* We will present our findings in a report, including visualizations and statistical analysis to support our conclusions. We will also provide recommendations to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio based on our findings.
